web application which shows in real-time files and directories of some server-side directory 
(preferred either temp or home directory) including real-time changes.
Server-side should-t keep directories in memory - need to iterate through root folder 
and send them to the web application
Server-side need to observe folder / files changes to send those changes as well.
